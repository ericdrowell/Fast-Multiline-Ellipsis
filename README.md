##Fast-Multiline-Ellipsis

This github project provides a very fast multi-line ellipsis solution using very light weight JavaScript (about 15 lines).  The CSS is very simple and flexible, and the markup is slim as well.  You only need to create a single ellipsis class.  This stategy also provides you with full control of how the ellipsis looks via CSS.  You can also use text instead, such as "show more"
